## Using OAuth with the Ohloh API

### What is OAuth?

[OAuth](http://oauth.net/) is an open protocol that allows applications and websites to share sensitive data, without requiring you to release your password. Using OAuth, you can permit third-party applications to read from your Ohloh account without having to share your password.

Instead of handing out your Ohloh account password to a third-party application, you visit the Ohloh website directly and grant that application permission to access your Ohloh account. You can revoke this permission any time you change your mind.

### Using OAuth 
In order to become Ohloh OAuth consumer, you'd need to get your key and secret from your [API Keys](http://www.ohloh.net/accounts/me/api_keys) page. Ohloh supports OAuth 1.0a. 
[ohloh_oauth_sinatra.rb](/examples/oauth/ohloh_oauth_sinatra.rb) is a simple [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) based example using [oauth gem](https://github.com/oauth-xx/oauth-ruby) that fetches authenticated user's [account](/reference/account.md) xml.

Although not affiliated with Ohloh, [OmniAuth](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) appears to have Ohloh strategy available [here](https://github.com/RodrigoAyala/omniauth-ohloh). This code is not supported, tested or verified by Ohloh.

### Developer Information
OAuth is an optional, additional feature of the Ohloh API that can be used to integrate Ohloh users on your website using their authenticated identity. You can read public data from Ohloh at any time using only your applicationâ€™s Ohloh API Key.
