## Factoid

A Factoid is a short, high-level bullet point delivering a simple observation about a [Project](/reference/project.md). Factoids are derived from an Analysis, and new Factoids are created for a Project every time a new [Analysis](/reference/analysis.md) is created.

On the Open Hub web site, Factoids are rendered in the Nutshell section of the project summary page. Factoids also are available in several of the sharing widgets available for embedding on websites.

A Project has factoids only if Open Hub has downloaded and analyzed its source code.

### Properties
+ __id__
The unique ID for the Factoid. Factoid IDs change every time the Project is reanalyzed, so itâ€™s unwise to store these IDs for long periods.

+ __analysis_id__
The unique ID of the [analysis](/reference/analysis.md) used to calculate this factoid.

+ __type__
The Factoid type. The possible types are defined below.

+ __description__
A short, human-readable description. This is the bullet point text which appears on the Open Hub project page.

+ __severity__
An integer from -3 to +3 which rates the relative severity of the factoid. Negative numbers generally indicate bad news, positive numbers generally indicate good news. Open Hub uses these numbers to select icons to display beside the factoids. All factoids of the same type have the save severity.

### Collection URL
To get a list of all current Factoids for a particular Project:
```shell
curl https://www.openhub.net/p/{project_id}/factoids.xml 
```
The collection request does not support any filtering, sorting or paging. You will always receive the entire collection of factoids, ordered by descending priority.

__Note about "mostly written in"__  - "... is mostly written in" bullet point listed in the Nutshell section of project summaries and in widgets displaying factoid information is not technically a factoid. This element is actually the `main_language_name` property on an [analysis](/reference/analysis.md).
