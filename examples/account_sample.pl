=head1 NAME

account_sample.pl - Simple example of using the Ohloh API from Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

account_sample.pl api_key email

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a small example of how to use the Ohloh API from Perl,
mimicking the Ruby example - account_sample.rb

Detailed information about the Ohloh API can be found at
https://github.com/blackducksw/ohloh_api

The script takes an API key and the email address of a developer
registered on Ohloh as parameters, and prints out all the
information of that account.

=head1 EXAMPLE

    ./account_sample.pl YOUR_API_KEY_HERE robin@ohloh.net

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

This script uses
L<LWP::Simple> (to query the Ohloh website),
L<Digest::MD5> (to MD5s the email address as requested by the API)
and
L<XML::Simple> (to parse the server's answer).

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to account_sample version 0.1
