### A Note about Country Codes
Ohloh preferentially uses the [Google Maps API](http://www.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/index.html) geocoder to resolve location names entered by users. `country_code` values obtained from the Google Maps API use two-letter abbreviations.

However, Google’s coverage is not complete, and not all countries can be resolved. For countries that cannot be resolved by the Google geocoder, Ohloh falls back to the Yahoo geocoder. These countries include the United Kingdom and China. `country_code` values obtained from Yahoo are full country names, not two-letter abbreviations.

For this reason, there are two data formats intermingled in country_code. Ohloh does not use this data internally, so the data has not been cleaned and unified.
