## Kudo
A Kudo is a simple gesture of thanks, praise, or endorsement from an Open Hub [account](/reference/account.md) to another person. An account may send Kudos to as many people as desired.

Kudos can be sent directly to another Open Hub account, or they may be sent to a contributor on a Project who does not have an Open Hub account. This flexibility makes Kudo records slightly complex.

When a Kudo is sent directly to an Open Hub Account, the recipient is identified by `receiver_account_id`.

When a Kudo is sent to a contributor on a Project who does not have an Account, the Kudo record contains both `contributor_id` and `project_id`, which together uniquely identify the recipient.

Ocassionally, an Open Hub Account holder may claim to be a Project contributor who has some existing Kudos. When this happens, the existing Kudos become linked to the Account, and the Kudos will now have all three properties: `receiver_account_id`, `contributor_id`, and `project_id`.

### Properties

### Collection URL
To get a list of all Kudos received by an Account:
```shell
curl https://www.openhub.net/accounts/{account_id}/kudos.xml
```
To get a list of all Kudos sent by an Account:
```shell
curl https://www.openhub.net/accounts/{account_id}/kudos/sent.xml 
```
These methods do not support any sorting, filtering, or paging options. You will always receive the complete list of all Kudos, sorted from new to old.

If you do not know the Account ID, you can also query for Kudos using the MD5 hash of the email address. Read more about email-based queries [here](/email_lookup.md).
