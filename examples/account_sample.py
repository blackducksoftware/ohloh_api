This is an example of using the Open Hub API from Python.

Detailed information can be found on GitHub:

     https://github.com/blackducksw/ohloh_api

This example uses the ElementTree library for XML parsing
(included in Python 2.5 and newer):

     http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm

This example retrieves basic Open Hub account information
and outputs it as simple name: value pairs.

Pass your Open Hub API key as the first parameter to this script.
Open Hub API keys are free. If you do not have one, you can obtain one
at the Open Hub website:

     https://www.openhub.net/accounts/<your_login>/api_keys/new

Pass the email address of the account as the second parameter to this script.
